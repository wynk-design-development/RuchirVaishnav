#Angular 2/TS Webpack project for Upwork test

**Answers to considerations**
Typescript was used during development because it is more strict and allows stricter checking hence less errors during production.
Material Design was used in place of Bootstrap as it has a strong sense of design with Bootstrap functionality already implemented into the library as well as coupling with Angular 2 quite nicely as the authors are the same company. A custom design can be implemented, but was not as the material design was sufficient for the size of this test. Data is hardcoded in but pulled from static variables that could easily be switched for an http service data object from a server.
